# Treasure Generator!!!


IT'S HORRIBLY BROKEN!!!

## Goals

* Have it not be broken
* Why is it broken?
* Can we have software that *ACTUALLY WORKS!?!?!?!?!*

I don't have time to fix all of the things that are brokem,
so I want *you* to fix them.  And add in a little bit of functionality
along the wat.

1. I want to be able to generate loot. And my tests are saying i cant!!! this is unfair and unjust and just not right!!!!
  I WANT MY THINGIES FIXED!!!
2. I want motre functionality!!! I want to be able to say:
  `(get-random-gear-for-encounter-level 5)` of cource I don't want
  the functuoin to be so verbose.  Name it something cool.
3. MAKE THE BROKEDED THINGS WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Oh, and make sure it's all spelt correctly.
